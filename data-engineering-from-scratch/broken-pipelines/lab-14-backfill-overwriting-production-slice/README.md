# Backfill Accidentally Overwriting Current Production Slice

> **Category**: `backfills`
> **Motto**: Understand it. Ingest it. Model it. Transform it. Validate it. Break it. Recover it. Scale it. Operate it.

## 1. Problem Description
A backfill script intended for 2025 omits partition filter in DELETE statement, truncating 2026 data.

## 2. Failure Symptoms
- Downstream metrics drift, silent row multiplication, or unhandled process termination.
- Pipeline execution exit code may erroneously report `SUCCESS` while data is mathematically corrupt.

## 3. Investigation & Diagnosis
1. Inspect the broken script in `broken_pipeline.py`.
2. Observe how the failure occurs under real input.
3. Compare with the resilient architecture in `solution/fixed_pipeline.py`.

## 4. How to Verify
Run the lab test suite:
```bash
pytest broken-pipelines/lab-14-backfill-overwriting-production-slice/test_lab.py
```
