# Streaming Consumer Lag Backpressure Overflow

> **Category**: `streaming`
> **Motto**: Understand it. Ingest it. Model it. Transform it. Validate it. Break it. Recover it. Scale it. Operate it.

## 1. Problem Description
Upstream broker produces 50k events/sec; single-threaded consumer processes 5k events/sec until buffers exhaust memory.

## 2. Failure Symptoms
- Downstream metrics drift, silent row multiplication, or unhandled process termination.
- Pipeline execution exit code may erroneously report `SUCCESS` while data is mathematically corrupt.

## 3. Investigation & Diagnosis
1. Inspect the broken script in `broken_pipeline.py`.
2. Observe how the failure occurs under real input.
3. Compare with the resilient architecture in `solution/fixed_pipeline.py`.

## 4. How to Verify
Run the lab test suite:
```bash
pytest broken-pipelines/lab-23-stream-consumer-lag-backpressure-overflow/test_lab.py
```
