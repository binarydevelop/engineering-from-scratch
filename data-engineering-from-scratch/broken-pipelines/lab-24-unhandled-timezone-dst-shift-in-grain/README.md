## 1. Problem Description
Using local clock string without UTC offset creates duplicate 01:00 AM hours during fall-back DST shift.

## 2. Failure Symptoms
- Downstream metrics drift, silent row multiplication, or unhandled process termination.
- Pipeline execution exit code may erroneously report `SUCCESS` while data is mathematically corrupt.

## 3. Investigation & Diagnosis
1. Inspect the broken script in `broken_pipeline.py`.
2. Observe how the failure occurs under real input.
3. Compare with the resilient architecture in `solution/fixed_pipeline.py`.

## 4. How to Verify
Run the lab test suite:
```bash
pytest broken-pipelines/lab-24-unhandled-timezone-dst-shift-in-grain/test_lab.py
```
