## 1. Problem Description
A partially written Parquet file missing its 4-byte 'PAR1' magic footer byte causes entire directory scans to abort.

## 2. Failure Symptoms
- Downstream metrics drift, silent row multiplication, or unhandled process termination.
- Pipeline execution exit code may erroneously report `SUCCESS` while data is mathematically corrupt.

## 3. Investigation & Diagnosis
1. Inspect the broken script in `broken_pipeline.py`.
2. Observe how the failure occurs under real input.
3. Compare with the resilient architecture in `solution/fixed_pipeline.py`.

## 4. How to Verify
Run the lab test suite:
```bash
pytest broken-pipelines/lab-32-corrupted-parquet-footer-dictionary-crash/test_lab.py
```
